### Political Communication
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the research area I have had most of my experience in. The work I have conducted in this topic is a literature review focusing on the main kinds of false information (e.g., disinformation, misinformation, and fake news) and the ways it is present within online spheres. It synthesizes academic journal articles that detail how the algorithms of social media platforms and video-sharing websites tend to promote false information, such as anti-vaccine rhetoric. My project also reviews articles that study how disinformation can serve as a gateway for young males to fall under far-right ideologies, focusing on the manosphere and redpilling. These ideologies revolve around the demonization of marginalized communities, the deprecation of women, while also inciting violence towards others and even oneself.


## Research Interests
### Mexican Politics/Democratic Backsliding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic backsliding is where leaders take actions that weaken democratic processes and institutions, such as executive aggrandizement, suppressing political parties, undermining elections, increasing militarization, and reducing civil liberties. I have done some work in this area. In one of my projects, I performed an audit on the state of democracy in Bolivia. In this project, I provide an overview of Bolivia's recent electoral history. From there, I audit their government and assign a score out of 10 based on the following factors: electoral decision, participation, policy responsiveness, accountability, and sovereignty. My analysis suggests that the state of democracy in Bolivia is relatively poor, and I propose policies to help restore its democracy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly interested in researching how democratic backsliding may be present in Mexico. Actions from the past two presidents, Claudia Sheinbaum and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), have come under fire for potentially weakening democracy. Some examples of this include the way judicial independence may have been at risk by allowing the judicial branch to be elected democratically, or ways that AMLO had weakened the body responsible for organizing elections. I think it would be interesting to research this topic further and look for characteristics of democratic backsliding.
