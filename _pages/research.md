### Political Communication
  This is the research area I have had most of my experience in. The work I have conducted in this topic is a literature review focusing on the main kinds of false information (e.g., disinformation, misinformation, and fake news) and the ways it is present within online spheres. It synthesizes academic journal articles that detail how the algorithms of social media platforms and video-sharing websites tend to promote false information, such as anti-vaccine rhetoric. My project also reviews articles that study how disinformation can serve as a gateway for young males to fall under far-right ideologies, focusing on the manosphere and redpilling. These ideologies revolve around the demonization of marginalized communities, the deprecation of women, while also inciting violence towards others and even oneself.
