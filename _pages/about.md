🎓 I am an aspiring political science student in my senior year at California State University, San Bernardino.

📚 Recently, I have been working as a research assistant for a faculty member in my department. The focused research topic involves political communication, specifically the effects of social media influencers. As the research is in its initial steps, my role has involved reading relevant scholarly articles and compiling pertinent information into an annotated bibliography.

📱 As part of a fellowship, I have also conducted independent research regarding political communication. My topic covers the kinds of false information that are present in online platforms and how specific types of false information can serve as a platform for people to shift their political beliefs to ones that do not fit the status quo. It examines the factors that contribute to people adopting these increasingly extreme views, along with the ways participants act once they subscribe to these beliefs, and how they may be particularly harmful to oneself and others.

🔬 My research interests include political communication, American politics, Mexican politics, Chicano history, immigration policy, democratic backsliding, political parties, and economic policy.

👨🏻‍🎓 As of next fall, I will be attending UC Irvine for graduate school. I will be studying with the goal of obtaining a Ph.D in Political Science with a concentration in American politics.

🎮 Outside of academia, I spend my time playing video games, going on nature walks, reading books, and playing with my cat.

📖 Book I am currently reading: The Jakarta Method by Vincent Bevins
